Notes:

   * Kind of a half-hearted job, Tate.  You found some of the QR codes
     because some started at the first pixel in the upper left of the image
     but that's hardly a consistent method for finding them.

   * Code does not compiler without warnings

   * Unwanted files (*.o) in the repository
